Repo of all algorithms needed to know for Polish Computer Science Maturity Exam (explained by a dumdum)

## Premise
So basically, I'm (writing this in 2025) a last class in technician school and in May 2025, will be writing mandatory, in Polish schools, maturity exam to prove that I know the basics of three obligatory subjects: **Polish, Math and English**.

Yet, you can also pick yourself up to six additional subjects _(that will be obviously higher level of difficulty to test your expertise)_.

Me being a masochist picked Computer Science knowing that I could fail it miserably but still, I'm willing to give my best.

Overall my incentive of creating this repo is to share my progress of learning basically all algorithms in core curriculum for this maturity exam.
Hopefully also creating a concise and easy to understand implementation of those algorithms and explanations of it :>

## Nice sources
[!NOTE]
> A warning note! Keep in mind that I'm no math expert and might write things completely out of my ass

_Implementations of the algorithms were made by courtesy of those sources (sometimes with some tinkering of mine) that definitely a must if you are like a dumdum like me._
